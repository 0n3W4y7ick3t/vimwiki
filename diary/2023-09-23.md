I ran 12km in 71mins this evening, it was my best record so far!
My knees began to hurt after I finished 10km, so I guess this level of running should only be done twice at most in a month.
My next plan is go to a swimming pool nearby, so I can do much more balanced exercise and burn more fat without worring about knee isssues.

Fight!
