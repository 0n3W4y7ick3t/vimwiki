damn should i write a plugin to move my mouse every 3 seconds????

note(in November 18 2023): 
I solved this problme where the screen turns off after a while by put a file in X server's configure dir:

░▒▓     /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d                                                03:40:26 PM   ▓▒░ 
❯ cat 50-noblankscreen.conf 
Section "ServerFlags" 
    Option "BlankTime" "0" 
EndSection
